Ever found yourself manually copying notes from Obsidian to paste into ChatGPT or Claude? I built this plugin to solve that exact problem.

Smart Export automatically finds all the notes connected to your starting point and exports them in a format that LLMs can actually work with. No more copy-pasting individual notes or losing the connections between your ideas.

## What it does

### Smart note discovery

The plugin follows your wikilinks to find related notes, just like you would when exploring your vault. It uses a breadth-first search, so it finds the most directly connected notes first, then branches out.

### Flexible depth control

You can control how deep it goes in two ways:

- **Content depth**: How many levels of notes to include with full content
- **Title depth**: How many additional levels to include with just titles for context

This lets you get exactly the right amount of context without overwhelming your LLM.

### Multiple export formats

- **XML**: Structured format with metadata (good for analysis)
- **LLM Markdown**: Clean format optimized for AI consumption
- **Print-friendly**: Simple format for human reading

### Token awareness

The plugin estimates how many tokens your export will use and warns you if you're approaching common LLM limits (like GPT-4's 128k or Claude's 200k).

## Getting started

### Manual install

For beta testing and the easiest way to install pre-release plugins, use the [BRAT (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tool)](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin by TfTHacker:

1. In Obsidian, go to **Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins ‚Üí Browse** and search for "BRAT" by TfTHacker. Install and enable it.
2. Once BRAT is enabled, open its settings and click **Add a new plugin**.
3. Paste this repository link: `https://github.com/LittleHaku/smart-export-for-llms`
4. Select the latest version when prompted.
5. BRAT will handle installation and updates for you.

This is the recommended way to beta test plugins, as it keeps everything up to date and avoids manual file management.


## How to use it

1. **Open the export dialog**: Click the üß† brain icon or use Cmd/Ctrl+P ‚Üí "Smart Export"
2. **Pick your starting note**: It'll default to your current note, or you can choose any note
3. **Set your depths**: I recommend starting with Content Depth: 3, Title Depth: 6
4. **Choose your format**: XML for structured data, Markdown for readability
5. **Export**: Click "Export to Clipboard" and paste into your favorite LLM

## Example exports

### XML format

```xml
<obsidian_export>
  <metadata>
    <export_timestamp>2025-01-25T10:30:00.000Z</export_timestamp>
    <starting_note>Machine Learning</starting_note>
    <total_notes_exported>5</total_notes_exported>
    <missing_notes_count>0</missing_notes_count>
  </metadata>
  <note_contents>
    <note id="1" name="Machine Learning">
      <![CDATA[# Machine Learning
      Content with [[wikilinks]] preserved...]]>
    </note>
  </note_contents>
</obsidian_export>
```

### LLM Markdown

```markdown
# Obsidian Vault Export

**Export Details:**

- Starting Note: Machine Learning
- Total Notes: 5
- Export Depth: Content (3), Titles (6)
- Generated: 2025-01-25T10:30:00.000Z

## Note Contents

### 1. Machine Learning

# Machine Learning

Content with [[wikilinks]] preserved...
```

## Settings

You can customize the defaults in Settings ‚Üí Smart Export for LLMs:

- **Default Content Depth**: How deep to go with full content (1-20)
- **Default Title Depth**: How deep to go with titles only (1-30)
- **Default Export Format**: Your preferred output format
- **Auto-select Current Note**: Whether to automatically pick your active note

## What I use it for

### Research analysis

I'll export a cluster of notes about a topic and ask the LLM to identify themes, connections, and gaps in my thinking.

### Writing help

When I'm writing about something, I export my research notes and ask the LLM to help me structure the content or identify missing pieces.

### Knowledge discovery

Sometimes I'll export a broad set of notes and ask the LLM to suggest new connections or research directions I haven't explored yet.

### Study assistance

When learning something new, I export my notes and ask the LLM to create study guides or explain concepts in different ways.

## Tips for best results

### Token management

- Start with Content Depth 2-3 for most uses
- Use Title Depth 5-8 to get broader context without overwhelming content
- Watch the token counter to stay within your LLM's limits

### Organizing your notes

- Use descriptive note titles (they show up in title-only levels)
- Create hub notes that link to related concepts
- Keep your wikilinks clean and consistent

### Export strategies

- **Deep dive**: High content depth (4-6) for comprehensive analysis
- **Broad overview**: Low content depth (1-2), high title depth (8-12) for big picture
- **Balanced**: Medium depths (3/6) for most research and writing

## Common issues

**"No notes found" or empty export?**

- Make sure your starting note has wikilinks to other notes
- Check that the linked notes actually exist in your vault
- Verify the note names match your wikilinks exactly

**Token count too high?**

- Reduce your Content Depth or Title Depth
- Pick a more specific starting note with fewer connections
- Try the Print-Friendly format for smaller exports

**Missing links reported?**

- Check the export output for the list of missing notes
- Fix any broken wikilinks in your vault
- Make sure you're using exact note names in your links
